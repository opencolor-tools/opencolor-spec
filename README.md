# Open Color Format Specification

The Specification is hopefully self explanatory. We didn't want the document to be super formal,
but it should be accurate enough to write a parser on your own.

Please take a look at the [opencolor-js](https://github.com/opencolor-tools/opencolor-js) project which implements a parser in understandable JavaScript and exposes the parsed OCO with a simple object tree.

If you feel that something is wrongly documented or should be changed, please don't hesitate to
file an issue.
